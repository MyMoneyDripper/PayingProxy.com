# How We Rank Bandwidth Sharing Apps

Welcome to ShareData.app! Our mission is to help you turn your unused internet bandwidth into predictable, passive income.

To do this, we go beyond simple earnings claims. We meticulously test and evaluate every bandwidth sharing app using a comprehensive scoring system focused entirely on **your experience, security, and financial return.**

Our evaluation is built on three core categories of metrics: **Financial Return**, **Payout Reliability**, and **Safety & Risk.**

## 💰 Category 1: Financial Return (Maximizing Your Earnings)

These metrics determine how much you actually make and how quickly you can access your money. This is the **most heavily weighted** part of our score.

| Metric | Why It Matters to You | Key Insight We Provide |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Effective Earning Rate (EER)** | This is your true paycheck. It's the only way to compare apps with different payment structures. | **Average Earnings per Gigabyte (GB) Shared** ($/GB). This is tracked and reported based on real-world usage in various regions. |
| **Minimum Payout Threshold** | The "waiting period" before you can touch your money. A lower threshold is always better. | The dollar amount required for withdrawal (e.g., $5, $10, $20). We prioritize apps with the **lowest threshold.** |
| **Time to First Payout** | The practical amount of time you need to run the app before getting your first deposit. | *Calculated as:* Payout Threshold / Average Daily Earnings. We estimate the time it takes an average user (in days or weeks). |
| **Location & IP Premium** | Earnings are highly dependent on demand. We identify which apps pay a premium for specific locations (e.g., U.S., Europe) or IP types (Mobile vs. Residential). | Highlights if an app is worth it based on your specific geographical location and network setup. |
| **Bonus Earning Features** | Non-data-sharing ways to earn. | Credit for **Content Delivery (CD)**, Daily Logins, or integrated **Surveys** can significantly boost your total income. |

## 🔁 Category 2: Payout Reliability & App Consistency

It’s not enough to earn money; you need to be able to cash out when you want to. These metrics focus on the trust and administrative health of the platform.

| Metric | Why It Matters to You | Key Insight We Provide |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Payout Failure Rate** | The percentage of reported withdrawal requests that were delayed, canceled, or required lengthy support intervention. | Measures the administrative and technical reliability of the platform's payment systems. |
| **Earnings Consistency** | How much your earnings fluctuate day-to-day. High volatility makes passive income unpredictable. | We track the variance in daily earnings. A score of **High Consistency** means more predictable passive income. |
| **Payment Method Diversity** | The options available for withdrawing your cash. | We rank apps based on support for common methods like **PayPal, Bitcoin/Crypto (JMPT), and Gift Cards.** |
| **Customer Support Quality** | How quickly and effectively the app's support team resolves issues, especially payment problems. | Average response time and resolution rate based on user reports and our own testing. |

## 🛡️ Category 3: Safety, Security, & Risk Mitigation

When you share your IP, you are giving up a piece of your network privacy. We evaluate the non-financial risks you face.

| Metric | Why It Matters to You | Key Insight We Provide |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IP Reputation Risk Score** | Your IP address could get flagged as a "known proxy," leading to CAPTCHAs, bans on banking/streaming sites, or security alerts. | We assess how aggressive the app is and its history of blacklisting incidents. **Low Risk** is essential. |
| **Traffic Transparency** | Knowing *what* is using your bandwidth ensures it isn't used for illegal or questionable activities. | We verify the app's official clients (e.g., market research, ad verification) and report on any claims of misuse or lack of clarity. |
| **Device Overhead** | The hidden cost of running the app. High CPU/RAM usage can affect your primary work and increase electricity costs. | We measure the application's resource consumption to ensure the earnings aren't offset by high operating costs. |
| **Multi-Device/IP Limits** | Your ability to scale your earnings by running the app on multiple devices or networks in your household. | We verify the explicit limits set by the provider (e.g., "3 devices per IP" or "Unlimited devices"). |
